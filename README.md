Rock paper scissor game project for TOP.

## WOW

I honestly didn't expect to do this without looking anything up, I just used my noggin and the debugger to solve any problems my brain skipped over.

This was honestly the first REALLY hard project. It required me to use all of my previous knowledge on JS to execute it, but I did it!
Excited to see what's going to be my next project assignment!
