# rock-paper-scissors

Rock paper scissor game project for TOP.

## WOW

I honestly didn't expect to do this without looking anything up, I just used my noggin and the debugger to solve any problems my brain skipped over.

This was honestly the first REALLY hard project. It required me to use all of my previous knowledge on JS to execute it, but I did it!
Excited to see what's going to be my next project assignment!


## UI

The UI update is done! There was a couple of hiccups here and there, but I managed to do this as well. The design is by yours truly (as you can probably tell cuz it sucks.)
